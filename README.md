# NcInme
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm <strong>NC InMe</strong>, a [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org) learner, currently undergoing a Web Development bootcamp designed by [HyperionDev](https://www.hyperiondev.com/). I have previously completed an online bootcamp for Python [100 days of code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code). 

One must commit to life long learning. It is especially true if you want to build a successful career in the software industry. I somehow survived, or dare I say thrived, without writing a line of code for almost 22 years (I stopped coding after first 3 years of my joining a software services company). The Pandemic, work from home, provided an opportunity to invest time in learning something new - hence my nom de plume - New Coder In Me :). 

Well, homo sapians outperfored all other species through collaboration. I would be very happy to help the fellow JavaSript and Python learners with my limited knowledge. Feel free to reach out to me. Onwards and Upwards!!!

This repository highlights the list of projects, showcasing my learning so far.
